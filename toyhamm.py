# Testing simple Hamming code for C(39,32),C(72,64),C(137,128),C(266,256) 
# UPDATE: Nov 20 2013: Include DED functionality by overall parity bit ;
# use error_status_code to switch to error scenarios detected 
#TODO: larger G/H for wider information word length

#parity matrix is in G=[I,P] so H=[P',I]
